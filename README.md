# datagrind
This repository includes projects and code I've developed to grow my abilities in data analytics. I will capture and summarize my efforts in this file as I 'grind through the data' in the coming months. 

March 20: Practiced searching and extracting with regular expressions.  

March 19: Uploaded 'letter_frequency', a snippet of code that reads a file and prints out letters in decreasing order of frequency. Nothing impressive, but a helpful little exercise.
